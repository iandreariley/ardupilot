#Ardupilot Modified for Companion Computer#

This fork of the Ardupilot has a few specific changes that allow a companion computer (or any other entity connected via MAVLink) to use fake GPS data to send an APM device waypoints relative to its current position. It's currently maintained (poorly and infrequently) by a joint effort of the Cal Poly Pomona Aerospace and Computer Science departments.

### How to Make It Do Right ###

Have you never written a line of code in your life? Then this is for you! The page you're looking at is the root directory of a github repository. It's a place where you can store information (usually code) and share it with people. It uses a program called Git that manages different version of projects (e.g. source code) across several locations. You will need to install git, which you can get here: [code](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

To copy a version of all this Ardupilot code to your computer, run the following command in a command line:

[code](git clone --recursive https://github.com/iandreariley/ardupilot)
